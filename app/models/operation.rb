# An operation represents work to be performed in the background.
# This model stores the state of the background job but does not
# actually perform any of the work itself and should not be subclassed
# when creating a new type of operation.
# To implement a new type of operation, subclass `OperationJob` and
# implement the `perfom(operation, *args)` method.
